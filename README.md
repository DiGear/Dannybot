# Dannybot

The swiss army knife of chat bots. Originally written for a small group of friends to use as a front-end for various services.

Dannybot is *both* a character designed by the [owner of this repo](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvFaYPlNH5xA8u6EETrdbtg) and a chat bot portraying said character.

## Notes from FDG
---

This bot has been in the works for three years. It has been ported to cogs, refactored several times, stolen many lines of code from stack overflow. But it's finally being entirely written from scratch. This bot was always meant to be for use in my personal chat server. But I think other people may take interest in seeing how it works, and also have the option to host their own modified versions of Dannybot.

This bot has historically (and probably still does to some extent) take code from sources such as stack overflow. I do not mind if you take code from this bot in order to learn or improve, but please don't claim to have written the code yourself.

Additionally, I would like to thank my friends for helping me get the bot to the point it is now.

# Usage
---

This bot needs way more python modules than is worth mentioning here, so just make sure you have everything in `requirements.txt`.

This bot requires a bit of setting up in order to host.
Make sure that everything in `config.py` is configured for your own computer, including token and directories located outside of Dannybots working directory.
The bot has text files to help you set up the `.env` file, as well as the `database` folder.
